-- Algo is step by step process to solve a problem which is user understandable
-- Best Case : Minimum Time (Atleast) Taken by Algo  to Solve a problem/ to give output
-- Worst Case: Max Time (Atmost) Time Taken by Algo To Solve a problem/ to give output



-- Space Complexity: Amount of Size an Algorithm needs in its life Cycle

    --- Fixed Part : Fixed Space require to store certain variables 
                     and constants or programs

    --- Variable Part : Dynamic Memory require during process life cycle 
                        like: stack,recursion, heap space etc


-- Time Complexities are Approximation

-- Common Errors: 
        -Input and Output Format
        -Time Limit Constrains
        -RunTime Error
        -CompileTime Error
        -Wrong Answers
        -Int OverFLow

-- if we write O(1) then it indicates that output of program will not be dependent on input
   set it will be constant

-- log n time complexity comes when input is reduced in linear time
-- QuasiLinear = O(nlogn)
   
--- USE DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself
