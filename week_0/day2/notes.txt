-- In python memory can be understand as Union ( Shared memory  from C)

-- Dynamic Allocation will never try to allocate mem randomly it will first check fro sequential Allocation 
   and if it doesn't find contiguous memory then it may go for random allocation

-- that's why DMA (Dynamic memory Allocation) must have  a pointer

-- Default datatype is string  and default data structure is tuple

-- Double Quotes(" ") signifies that its collection of various  single Quotes (' ')
   while collection of various Double Quotes can be done using Wrapping them in 
   Triple Strings (''' ''')
