Greedy :          Helps in Optimization 
                         or
         Requires to get Optimal Solution from feasible Solution
           by taking the current best (Local Optimum)

Selects the current best without considering future best Option 
and starts solving
               
               optimization Problems

      Feasible sol^n       optimized sol^n    
     (Possible sol^n )       (BEST sol^n )


example: Prims and Kruskal Algo:
          -- here they try to choose the 
               minimum edge for making 

However Greedy Doesn't guarantee Optimum solution all the time:
