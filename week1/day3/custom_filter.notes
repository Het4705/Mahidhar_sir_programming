In Python, the == operator checks for equality between two objects. However, when comparing 2 and int, they are two different types of objects: 2 is an integer literal, while int is a type itself.

Here's what's happening:

2 is an integer literal representing the number 2.
int is the built-in integer type in Python.
When you compare them using ==, Python checks if the two objects are the same, which they are not, hence the result is False.

If you want to compare whether 2 is an instance of the int type, you should use the isinstance() function:

python
Copy code
print(isinstance(2, int))  # Output: True
This will correctly output True, indicating that 2 is indeed an instance of the int type.
